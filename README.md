## 📌 Notes & Limitations

- This is a **demo / frontend-only** project
- All data is stored in the browser (`localStorage`)
  - Clearing browser data = losing all notes & habits
- Calendar is basic (no event support yet)
- Habit data migration from older version supported

## Future Improvements (Ideas)

- Dark mode
- Data sync with backend
- Habit reminders
- Rich text notes
- Better calendar with events
- Mobile PWA support
